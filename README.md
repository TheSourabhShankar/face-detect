# Face Detect

This is a dead simple example of how to use [tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/) library to detect face in live camera stream and how to trigger any user event.

**How to run:**
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Place the code in localhost (running any web server)
3. Open the file in browser (http://localhost/face-detect/face-detect.html)
4. Give permission to access your camera

**Keep in mind:**
1. Code will not work if html file is opened directly in browser (without webserver)
2. Camera permission needed
3. Similar to face detection, eyes and mouth can also be detected

PS: This is bare minimum code to detect a face and trigger any event but you can extend it to build some useful apps. Let your imagination run wild. Good luck.
